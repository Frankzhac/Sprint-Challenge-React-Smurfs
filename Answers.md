1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

  Server-side routing

    Loading a page involves requesting for an entire page, and only the content related to that page. It results in a full page refresh with the accompanying loading time for rendering every new page. This has been the standard for much longer and is thus more optimized for search engines

  Client-side routing

    'Loading' a page is not actually loading a new page; rather, it is simply the result of loading the whole web site and then determining what to display using instructions from a script. It only refreshes the parts of the page that change, resulting in smoother transitions through content.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?

  It stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

3.  What does CRUD stand for?

  It stands for create, retrieve, update, delete.

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

  Create: Post, Retrieve: Get, Update: Put, Delete: delete.

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

  Fetch, axios, async.
